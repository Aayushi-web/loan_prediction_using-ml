# Credit Card Behavior Prediction Score

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the behavior of credit card users based on various features. The notebook demonstrates the data preprocessing, exploration, and model building process using a dataset containing credit card-related information.

## Features

- **Data Importing**: The dataset is loaded from CSV files.
- **Data Exploration**: Descriptive statistics and data visualization are used to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Modeling**: Multiple machine learning models are implemented and evaluated to predict user behavior.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of information about credit card holders, including demographic data, usage behavior, and other features that can be used to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes (such as bad or good behavior). The two primary CSV files used are:

- **Dev_data_to_be_shared.csv**: Training data
- **validation_data_to_be_shared.csv**: Validation data
